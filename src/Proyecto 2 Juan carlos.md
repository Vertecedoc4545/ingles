I haven’t been eaten tortillas  

I have been drunk a lot of water 

I have been eaten cokes and stuff 

I haven’t been drunk soda for along time  

I have been drunk milk, because I like this  

I haven’t been eaten pambasos, because we had no more bread 

I haven’t been drunk Milkshake, every week 

I have been drunk jumex  

I haven’t been eaten tacos, because we don't go out as much  

I have been eaten chines food, because we almost always order it from a restaurant
